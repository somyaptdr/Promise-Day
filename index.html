    <h1><Mera Baccha></h1>
    <p>As <span class="main">Promise Day</span> dawns upon us, 
        I was thinking that how lucky im for having you in my life.
         With each passing day by day hour by hour and second by second, my love for you grows deeper, and my commitment to you strengthens.  
         <br>Today, I want to make you a promise - a promise to stand by your side through each and every situation, i know in past i have made many mistakes and some trust breaks too but the thing I have learnt is being with our person is more important than anything so i promise to be there for you for literally anything mera Baccha, 
         and to support you in your dreams and aspirations, and to cherish every moment we share together.

        I promise to be your partner, sometimes your motivator, and your best friend. I promise to listen to you(Mana thoda late palle padti hðŸ˜…), 
        to understand you, and to love you unconditionally. I promise to laugh with you in times of joy
         and hold you close in times of sorrow. I promise to respect you, to honor you, and to always be
          honest with you.
        
        But above all, I promise to love you fiercely and passionately, now and for all eternity. 
        You are my motivator, my favorate person, my love, and my everything, and I vow to spend the rest of my days making you happy.
        
        Happy Promise Day, mera baccha. Here's to a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless promises fulfilled.</p>
